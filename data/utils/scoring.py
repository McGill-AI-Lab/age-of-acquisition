scoring.py - Feature scoring functions for AoA, frequency, concreteness, and phonetic complexity.

    """
    Apply all four scorers to a batch of sentences.
    
    This is the main entry point for scoring. It processes an entire batch
    of sentences and returns all four feature scores for each sentence.
    
    Error handling: If any scorer fails for a sentence, that specific score
    is set to np.nan, but other scores are still computed. This ensures one
    failing scorer doesn't break the entire pipeline.
    
    Args:
        text_batch: List of sentences to score
                   Can be any length (typically 100K-200K for efficiency)
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with keys "aoa", "freq", "conc", "phon"
        Each value is a numpy array of shape (n,) where n = len(text_batch)
        Arrays contain float64 values (np.nan for scoring failures)
    
    Note:
        Does not filter out bad scores - keeps array length equal to input length.
        This maintains alignment with sentence IDs. Filtering happens later
        during regression (rows with NaN are excluded).
    
    Example:
        >>> texts = ["The cat sat", "Dogs bark loudly", ""]
        >>> scores = score_batch(texts)
        >>> scores['aoa']
        array([4.2, 5.1, nan])  # Empty sentence gets NaN
